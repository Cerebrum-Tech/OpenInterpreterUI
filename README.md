## Introduction

GuiStreamlitOpenInterpreter is a project aimed at simplifying the process of running code and interacting with OpenAI models through a graphical user interface (GUI). With Streamlit as the frontend framework, this tool provides an intuitive way to work with Python and OpenAI applications without needing to write code in a traditional coding environment.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for running Python code and others.
- Integration with OpenAI applications for natural language processing and chatbot functionalities.
- Simplified execution of code and interaction with OpenAI models.
- Customizable and extensible for different use cases.
